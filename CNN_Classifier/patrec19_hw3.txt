Assignment	Programming Assignment 3

(Replacement of final exam)

-----------------------
1. Design and implement a pattern classifier that classifies 10 MNIST hand-written images
  The image files are given (mnist_png.zip)

  mnist_png/training/0
  mnist_png/training/1
  ...
  mnist_png/training/9

  mnist_png/testing/0
  mnist_png/testing/1
  ...
  mnist_png/testing/9

  The subfolder names are class names
  Train your model with the files in "training" folder,
  calculate classification accuracies with the files in "testing" folder

  - Use one of the classifiers given in the lecture (k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, NN, etc.)
  - Any dimension reduction techniques (PCA, LDA, etc.) can be used
  - CNN or other deep learning methods can be used, but try to add your idea for improved performance
  - You may use downloaded code, but SPECIFY clearly which part of the codes were downloaded
    including web addresses, and which part are your own writings.
  - In the report, explain your method well, learning process (convergence graphs, etc),
    final accuracy, etc.

-----------------------
2. Incomplete training data case
A new set of training files are given, with 50% of the labels are incorrect.
Repeat 1 with the corrupted training dataset
Add your novel idea to handle such cases.

-----------------------
  *grading criteria:
  - novelty 30%
  - coding (your ID and name, specification of used code) 30%
  - report 40%

  *submission:
  - source code(s) without data - should be executable with the given image files
  - report in pdf format
